I’ve always been fascinated by the growing popularity of food photography on social media platforms. Everywhere I look—Instagram,
Pinterest, even Twitter—there are beautifully curated food images that capture attention. However, I noticed that while people love sharing and viewing these 
mages, they often lack the actual recipe knowledge needed to recreate the dishes they admire. I’ve also realized how frustrating and inefficient it is to
manually search for a matching recipe just from a photo or vague memory of ingredients. This inspired me to explore smarter solutions. I believe that by
integrating technology into our kitchens—through AI-powered tools—we can make cooking more accessible. Such systems can also support diet tracking and 
enhance culinary learning by providing step-by-step guidance based on what we see and have on hand.
